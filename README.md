# Simple sanity check of portable-endian.h

This projects aims to test and document when, how and where
[portable-endian.h](https://github.com/BenWiederhake/portable-endian)
works.

## Portability / requirements

Just like portable-endian itself, this battery of tests strives to be
extremely portable -- and succeeds, as far as I can tell.  Currently,
the `Makefile` requires POSIX make and probably POSIX shell (only as
part of `Makefile`).  Only if you need to change the Makefile (which is
automatically generated from `autogen.py`, you also need Python on
*any* system (not necessarily the system under test). Language major
version 2, of course.

## Dimensions

This project checks along the following dimenstions:
- OS:
    * Debian (used for development)
    * [Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Mac OS X](https://travis-ci.org/BenWiederhake/endian-ci)
    * [FreeBSD](https://gitlab.com/BenWiederhake/endian-ci/builds)
- Compiler: gcc, clang
- C standard ("language"): C89, gnu89, C99, gnu99, C11
- Integer support: all, without `uint64_t`
- Use case ("mode"):
    * default: used as header-only without any special flags
    * inline: used as header-only with additional hints to inline all functions
    * defhere: current compilation unit is "special" and *defines* all
      functions.
    * defext: used as external library (counter-part to
      defhere)
- Then, all functions of the library are checked to actually do their job.
  Furthermore, nilpotence is checked.  In other words, it must always hold
  that `x==betoh(htobe(x))` and `x==letoh(htole(x))`.

This is a typical example of combinatorial explosion.  However, the
execution time should be reasonable enough.

## Cross-platform testing

Coming soon.

With the current split into the targets `build-all` and
`run-all` (the latter just executes all binaries in `bin/`), it should
be well possible to cross-compile during `build-all`, copy the
executable to the target platform, and run them there.  Note that you
should not try to link them together.

## Compilers

I'd love to see Pull Requests to test this specifically with XCode and
MSVC.  Until then, It'll be gcc- and clang-only.

## Python script

Let me say sorry upfront.

However, I just found no way to pack *all* the logic for combinatorial
explosion, exception detection (e.g. "build C11 only if C11 is
supported") in a neatly readable, portable Makefile.  Thus, I opted for
an automatically generated Makefile.
